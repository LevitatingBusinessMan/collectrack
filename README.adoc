= Collect Rack

Collect Rack is a graphing frontend for https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/[.rrd] files generated by https://www.collectd.org/[collectd]

Before Collect Rack I made https://github.com/LevitatingBusinessMan/rrd2html.rb[rrd2html.rb] which is a very minimal (you could say code golfed) CGI application.
This project was born out of dissatisfaction with https://github.com/LevitatingBusinessMan/rrd2html.rb[rrd2html.rb] and inspired by https://github.com/pommi/CGP[pommi/CGP].
