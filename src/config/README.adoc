This is where the config parser lives.

It uses rexical and racc and tries to mimic the original collectd parser (which uses lex and yacc).

The original parsers are in the `real/` directory for reference.

=== Generating
Use the rake tasks to generate the scanner and parser.
```
rake lexer parser
```

The following files will be generated:
`parser.racc` -> `parser.tab.rb` 
`parser.rex` -> `parser.rex.rb`

=== Testing
There are a few tests for the parser.
```
rake spec
```

or simply run `rake` to both generate and test the parser.
