To release Collectrack, run `rake release x.y.z`.
Then push the commit and tags to github.

The Github CI will build a draft release with an automatically generated changelog and artifacts.
Please add a short explenation of the changes. 

A vendor tarball can be made using `rake vendor` and used for packaging.
This may be useful for offline build systems.

The OpenSUSE package specifically may be updated by (optionally) the vendor tarball and running the following fish script:

```fish
#!/usr/bin/env fish
osc rm (basename (pwd))-*{.obscpio,.tar}
osc service ra
osc add (basename (pwd))-*{.obscpio,.tar}
osc ci
```
