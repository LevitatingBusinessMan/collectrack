= For Developers

== Development
There is a development script `src/rerun.rb` which listens to sourcecode changes and restarts the puma server.

This script can be executed with `ruby src/rerun.rb` or `bin/rerun`.
It will execute `puma -e development` by default, other commands to start the server can be specified on the command line.
Do note that using `rackup` with this tool causes the host and port to reset.

```
bin/rerun
```

To generate and test the configuration parser run `rake`.

== Releasing
To release, run `rake release <version>` to update and commit the version.

When the Gemfile is altered, run `rake vendor` which will create a `vendor.tar.xz` file for use in packaging.
